    <h1>Notes from Lesson 1</h1>
<br>
<b>The Web</b>
<br>
<br>
HTML is Hyper Markup Language.  It is a document that contains all sort of content<br> but is the basis for everything on the web.
<br>
<br>
Your browser makes request that servers reply to with content.  HTTP is the protocol<br> that the browser uses to speak to servers.
<br>
<br>
HTML is made up of text content like what I am writing right now.  It is also made up<br> of links to content and markup which is the way a site looks.
<br>
<br>
<b>HTML</b>
<br>
<br>
HTML markup is made up of tags.  Which are made up of < Name > Contents Then<br> closing with < /name >
<br>
<br>
The B tag makes anything inside of the tag <b>BOLD</b>
<br><br>
The EM tag means emphasis aka <em>ITALICS</em>.
<br><br>
<b>HTML Attributes </b><br><br>
Anchor tag is a link tag that is <a href="www.cnn.com"><b>GREAT for checking the NEWS</b></a>
<br><br>
The Image tag is how you would link image content to the page!!  Image tags are VOID tags so they <br> do not need a closing tag.<br><br> <img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-wpY0G4CtTYI/U2UczOnkH3I/AAAAAAAAN0c/BfOlnGke790/w965-h543-no/20140503_17058" width="354" alt="OPP"><br><br>
Whitespace - The br tag allows for a line break.  It is also a void tag that does not need a closing tag.  <br><br>
In comparsion a P tag (paragrah) is not a void tag and requires a closing tag.  <br> <br>
The br tag in considered an inline tage which just breaks the line in comparsion to<br> the P tag which is a block tag that has an invisible box.<br><br>
Inline elements include B em br and even img tags<br><br>
Span is an inline element that contains it content.  It allows you to add <span class="foo">style to the content through CSS</span>.<br><br>
Div is a block element that contains its content. The div element will create a separate line.<br><br>
<b>HTML Structure</b><br><br>
An HTML document includes a head (meta and java etc.) with a title which would<br> be shown in the browser tab.  Then it has the body content which would contain<br> content like the kind I am making right now.<br><br>
